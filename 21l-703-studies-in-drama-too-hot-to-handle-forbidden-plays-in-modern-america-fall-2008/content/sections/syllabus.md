Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

Unlike film, theater in America does not have a ratings board that censors content. So plays have had more freedom to explore and to transgress normative culture. Yet censorship of the theater has been part of American culture from the beginning, and continues today. How and why does this happen, and who decides whether a play is too dangerous to see or to teach? Are plays dangerous? Sinful? Even demonic? In our seminar, we will study plays that have been censored, either legally or extra-legally (i.e. refused production, closed down during production, denied funding, or taken off school reading lists). We'll look at laws, both national and local, relating to the "obscene", as well as unofficial practices, and think about the way censorship operates in American life now. And of course we will study the offending texts, themselves, to find what is really dangerous about them, for ourselves.

Course Goals
------------

At the end of the course, students will be able to discuss modern American theater in the context of censorship, including the legal, political and historical discussions of obscenity, sexuality, gender, racism, socialism, and global politics. Students will also be familiar with research tools in the field, primary and secondary, and how to incorporate research and theory into their own writing and thinking.

Course Reading
--------------

Readings for the class include original plays, analysis of censorship in the theatre, and more general consideration of censorship issues in society. See the complete list in the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings) page.

Course Assignments
------------------

Over the course of the semester, you will asked to do the following:

*   Two written weekly questions/comments, on one or more reading from the week's assignment.
*   Paper: 4-page close reading of assigned passage from Mrs. Warren's Profession and its relation to the play as a whole.
*   Paper Project (15 pages) in 2 drafts. Discuss a modern or contemporary example of theatrical daring and repression not covered in the course. The paper will focus on a single play or performance as detailed example.
*   Presentations: approx. 20 minutes; 2-4 students: **either**
    *   a 5-minute scene from one of the plays studied in the course followed by a discussion of performance choices and methods, **or**
    *   a presentation on a theatrical production you have attended this semester. This includes a review (typed for submission), a discussion of the theater group and its history, and an analysis of the promotional materials for the production (paper, Web, etc.)
